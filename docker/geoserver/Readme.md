## Geoserver docker image

The aim of this docker image is to provide the vector tiles extension for the geoserver instance.
This image is only build manually if configurations of teh geoserver changes or the version needs to be updated.
It does not make sense building this docker image for each master push or release as this Docker image rarely changes.
